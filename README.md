# Overtime Horror: A Choose Your Adventure Game
Welcome to Overtime Horror â€“ a terrifying interactive experience set in the familiar yet unsettling environment of an office after hours. In this game, youâ€™ll step into the shoes of an overworked employee who stays late to finish up a project, only to find that the night shift holds much more than just quiet cubicles and dimmed lights. Navigate through eerie events, make crucial choices, and survive the nightâ€¦ if you can.

# ðŸŽ® Game Description
Overtime Horror is a text-based choose-your-own-adventure game designed to immerse you in a suspenseful horror experience set in a corporate office building. As you progress, youâ€™ll encounter various strange phenomena, from flickering lights and mysterious sounds to unsettling apparitions. Each choice you make will determine the outcome, leading to multiple possible endings â€“ will you escape, uncover a dark office secret, or fall victim to the horrors lurking in the shadows?

# Background
The idea for Overtime Horror came from the universal experience of working late nights in an office â€“ an environment that, when devoid of people and filled with shadows, can become unsettlingly eerie. Inspired by this sense of isolation and mystery, we wanted to explore the concept of everyday spaces turning sinister after hours. We chose a text-based format to allow for rich descriptions and an engaging, immersive experience, where each choice builds suspense and brings you closer to unraveling the secrets of the haunted workplace.
