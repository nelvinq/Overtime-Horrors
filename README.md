Welcome to Overtime Horror â€“ a terrifying interactive experience set in the familiar yet unsettling environment of an office after hours. In this game, youâ€™ll step into the shoes of an overworked employee who stays late to finish up a project, only to find that the night shift holds much more than just quiet cubicles and dimmed lights. Navigate through eerie events, make crucial choices, and survive the nightâ€¦ if you can.

# ðŸŽ® Game Description
Overtime Horror is a text-based choose-your-own-adventure game designed to immerse you in a suspenseful horror experience set in a corporate office building. As you progress, youâ€™ll encounter various strange phenomena, from flickering lights and mysterious sounds to unsettling apparitions. Each choice you make will determine the outcome, leading to multiple possible endings â€“ will you escape, uncover a dark office secret, or fall victim to the horrors lurking in the shadows?

# Background
The idea for Overtime Horror came from the universal experience of working late nights in an office â€“ an environment that, when devoid of people and filled with shadows, can become unsettlingly eerie. Inspired by this sense of isolation and mystery, I wanted to explore the concept of everyday spaces turning sinister after hours. I chose a text-based format to allow for rich descriptions and an engaging, immersive experience, where each choice builds suspense and brings you closer to unraveling the secrets of the haunted workplace.
